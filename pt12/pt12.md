### Problem 1

Complete [num.c](num.c) such that it receives a line from a user (ended by ``'\n'``), and repeats the line while replacing every number word to the corresponding numeric representation according to ``words``.
A word in a line is replaced with a number if the word is equivalent with a ``word`` field of ``words`` in
case-insensitive way.

For example, if a user gives ``there are Four apples and two oranges.``, the program must prints out the following:

```
there are 4 apples and 2 oranges.
```


### Problem 2 

Complete function ``show_next_darks`` in [reversi.c](reversi.c), which receives a status of 
a Reversi gameboard (a.k.a. Othello) and diplays next possible draws of a Dark (``X``) piece.

Given a gameboard status, a Dark piece (marked as ``X``) can be placed on a cell such that there exists 
at least one straight (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) occupied line between 
the new piece and another dark piece, with one or more contiguous Light (marked as ``O``) pieces between them
(c.f., https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversi ).

Global variable ``board`` represents the current status of the gameboard: ``0`` if the cell is not used,
``1`` if the Dark piece (``X``) is placed on the cell, or ``2`` if the Light piece (``O``) is placed.

Suppose that ``board`` is set up as follows:

```C
int board[8][8] = {
    {0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0},
    {0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0},
    {0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 0, 0},
    {0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 0, 0},
    {0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0},
    {0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0},
    {0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0},
    {0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0}
};
```

Your program must print out the following:

```
+ + + + + + + + 
+ + + + # + + + 
+ + + # O X + + 
+ + + + X O # + 
+ + + + + # + +
+ + + + + + + + 
+ + + + + + + + 
+ + + + + + + + 
 ```

A number sign (``#``) indicates the possible next cells to place a Dark piece.

### Problem 3

Write function ``create_triangle`` in the following program, that updates a ``triangle_t`` variable  ``t``
with the six arguments representing the locations of the three verticies.
Also, write function ``get_perimeter`` in the following program, that returns the perimeter of a given triangle ``t``.
Note that ``triangle_t`` is to represent a triangle whose three verticies are defined in the ``verticies`` field.

```C
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

typedef 
    struct {
        double x ;
        double y ;
    }
    point_t ;

typedef 
    struct {
        point_t verticies[3]
    }
    triangle_t ;

void create_triangle (triangle_t * t, double x1, double y1, double x2, double y2, double x3, double y3)
{
    /*FIXME*/
}

double get_perimeter (triangle_t * t)
{
    /*FIXME*/
}

int main ()
{
    triangle_t t ;

    create_triangle(&t, 2.0, 3.0, 2.0, 7.0, 5.0, 5.0) ;

    printf("%lf\n", get_perimeter(t)) ;
    
    return EXIT_SUCCESS ;
}
```
